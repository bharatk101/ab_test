# Analyze A/B Test 

This project is part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.


## Overview 
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert,"
meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page,
keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## Steps.

### 1 Data Wrangling:

* Remove duplicates records. 
* Remove the rows where the landing_page and group columns don't align.


### 2 Analysis

*  Compute probabilities of converting
*  Perform Hypothesis Testing and calculate p-values
*  Perform Z-Test and compare it with Hypothesis Test.
*  Conduct Logistic Regression


### Requirements

* Python 3.6 and up
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* statsmodels.api
* Jupyter Notebook
* scipy.stats
